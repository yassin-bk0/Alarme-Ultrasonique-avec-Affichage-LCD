## Overview
This project implements an ultrasonic security alarm system using a microcontroller, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a 16x2 I2C LCD display. The system continuously measures the distance to an object, and when a movement or intrusion is detected within a predefined safety range, the alarm is triggered.

The LCD screen provides real-time feedback, such as:

The measured distance

Alarm status (SAFE / ALERT)

System initialization messages

This project is designed as a simple and effective introduction to embedded systems, combining sensing, display output, and basic alert logic. It can be used for learning, prototyping home-security devices, or integrating into more advanced robotics projects.
