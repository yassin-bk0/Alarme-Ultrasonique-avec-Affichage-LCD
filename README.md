## Overview
**Robot Chain** is a compact robotic demonstration showing a chain-driven locomotion/actuation system and coordinated control between embedded firmware and a host computer. The project demonstrates mechanical design, motor control (PWM/encoder feedback), basic path-following, and a visual demo recorded in the linked video.
